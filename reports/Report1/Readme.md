# Progress Report :1       Yogesh Ganesh Phalak            20 June 2018
  

What I did not get done:
------------------------

-	As given in attached simulation video I am able to give angles to the actuators by the MATLAB code and user defined functions. But one of the bracket is always attached to the fixed frame so that I am unable to move the snake with respect to surroundings.
-	As in MATLAB environment there is not predefined ground so other parts of the robot are moving with respect to the frame of first bracket, but I haven’t generated ground frame yet.



Promises for next week:
-----------------------

-	I have decided to use “Simsape Multibody Contact Forces Library” for generating ground frame, in next week I am supposed to install and explore this library.

-	After successful ground generation in MATLAB environment I will import model of real snake and try apply forward, reverse, rolling and sidewinding gaits on it.

Ongoing things:
---------------

-	In last two weeks I have completed basic tutorials of MATLAB simulink and installed “simscape multibody link” in MATLAB from MathWorks website.
-	I have made the assembly of the cad model of the snake robot on which we were working on, but for learning purpose and complexities in the original assembly I assembled one test snake model.
-	I imported the test snake model in the MATLAB and given the angles to the actuators as per the forward gait we were using in the original snake.
-	I have attached the videos of both the cad models (original snake robot and test snake robot), video of the experiment on the snake model in the laboratory and the simulation of test snake with forward gait implemented.
